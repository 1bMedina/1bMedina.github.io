                <p2>The Arlington 2050 project is a year-long initiative that strives to get community feedback on what Arlington should look like in 2050 and the challenges we must address to get there. We were tasked with analyzing data from handwritten postcards, which included organizing them into location specific DataFrames, running spell check programs, and analyzing them in a multitude of ways.</p2>
